<meta name="description" content="The Jungle Times is an independent content publisher that focuses on information, news, and commentary about Auburn Basketball. The Jungle Times also aims to serve as a single place for Auburn Basketball fans to come together and share their thoughts and insights through the use of the open forum or comments they leave on posts. The Jungle Times shares predictions, game analysis, and other Auburn Basketball content straight from some of Auburn Basketball's biggest fans and most knowledgeable experts. Other than the standard news outlets, there aren't many blogs and online content publishers that focus on Auburn Basketball, and none focus just on Auburn Basketball. This is what The Jungle Times is here for and wants to establish itself as the best source of information for all things Auburn Basketball. The Jungle Times also serves as a project started and managed Jacob Varner, currently a Software Engineering student at Auburn University, that stands as a built-from-scratch website where he can combine his love for technology and programming as well as his passions and knowledge for Auburn Basketball.">
